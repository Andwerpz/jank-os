NOW
- implement network stack...
- rethink how i write the networking stack with big endian -> little endian
- also how i store ipv4 addresses, should probably change to u32 instead of u8[4]

LATER
- configure Interrupt Mask for later...
- make generic network device
- implement network stack...
- make that arp entry lookup not suck
- add expirations for arp entries, probably 60 seconds?
