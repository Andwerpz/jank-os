NOW
- implement network stack...
- UDP
- DHCP
- DNS
- TCP (make andrew do this cause im no good)

LATER
- how i handle buffers for the tx rx, rn i just pre alloc the buffers and keep using them, i should copy phys hardware buffer to a malloc'd buffer and set the hardware flag so that it can keep recieving?
- configure Interrupt Mask for later...
- make that arp entry lookup not suck
- add expirations for arp entries, probably 60 seconds?
- generic network device? move all globals for nic driver to own struct, possible to have multiple of same cards?
- add lease time to dhcp
