NOW
- TCP
- write in pseudoheader struct, fill in and calculate. (both tcp and udp)
- fill in states for UDP
- TEST SYSCALLS AND FILE OPS
- add syscall flag handling

LATER
- DNS
- make that arp entry lookup not suck
- arp queuing time out ttl
- add expirations for arp entries, probably 60 seconds?
- add lease time to dhcp
- add checks to prevent attempts for network activity when there is no network device present
- generic network device? move all globals for nic driver to own struct, possible to have multiple of same cards? void* for driver struct in net interface?

all the structs for networking that stay inside the kernel will keep everything in CPU order (little endian)
all functions will take in CPU order (little endian)
all the protocol structs that get sent over the wire will be network order (big endian)
