Universal Serial Bus (USB)
https://wiki.osdev.org/Universal_Serial_Bus

USB is a bus/standard used to communicate between the host and peripherals. 
to use a USB device, the host needs to implement:
 - a USB host controller driver
 - a USB core
 - a device driver for that device

the USB host controller driver handles low level and hardware details regarding talking via USB. 
the USB core uses the low level controller to actually implement USB semantics.
the core layer is the one exposed to the device drivers. The core layer should present a standard USB interface
so that the device drivers can be USB agnostic.
of course, the device drivers should just know how to use the USB api to talk to their specific device. 

USB is a polled bus, meaning that the host must initiate all transfers.


the host controller driver i'll probably implement is xHCI (eXtensible Host Controller Interface)
the 'host controller' is some integrated circuit that's does the hard work of synchronizing itself with 
devices connected to it and taking care of alot of other hardware and protocol details. 
what we are implementing is just some interface that's capable of talking to this hardware host controller
