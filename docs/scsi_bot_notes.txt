Bulk-Only Transfer (BOT)
https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/usbmassbulk_10.pdf
data wrapper protocol

how are they used together?
seems like BOT acts as a wrapper for the actual SCSI commands

so 'Normal TRB's are used to transmit bulk data between host and device. 
the data being transmitted follows the BOT protocol
and the BOT protocol itself acts as a wrapper for SCSI commands

a BOT transfer has 3 distinct phases:
 - CBW (Command Block Wrapper)
 - Data
 - CSW (Command Status Wrapper)
