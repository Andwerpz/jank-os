layout for now should be:

Boot sector (block 0 only)
Superblock
Group descriptor table
Block bitmap
Inode bitmap
Inode table
Data blocks

for a disk D:
it is split into mutliple block groups from 0-N
For older ext2 (without sparse super) it will replicate(?) the superblock and group descriptor table to each block group for error checking
We just use the primary superblock and group descriptor table for everything. (error checking is handled by god, just dont error out???)
