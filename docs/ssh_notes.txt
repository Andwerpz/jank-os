Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
essentially an encrypted bytestream

the SSH connection goes through a few states during its lifetime:
 - TCP connection
 - Identification exchange
   - confirm ssh version. 
   - send something like "SSH-2.0 ..." in plaintext
 - Algorithm negotiation
   - decide what encryption algorithms to use 
   - still using plaintext
   - client and server send eachother list of supported algorithms
   - both deterministically select the first mutually supported algorithms
 - Key EXchange (KEX)
   - create shared secret key using the chosen KEX algorithm
   - using the new secret, both sides derive symmetric keys
   - from now on, all packets are encrypted using these symmetric keys
 - Host Verification
   - host uses its private key to generate a message using the shared H generated during KEX
   - host sends message + host public key to client
   - client decrypts message using H to get the host public key, see if they match
 - User Authentication
   - client sends "ssh-userauth" request with selected key algorithm, client public key, and signature generated from private key
   - host verifies signature, and then checks that the public key is in its trusted public keys list
   - may have to try multiple times if the first algorithms the client suggests are not supported
 - Connection Phase
   - finally, can do actual work
   - during the connection, either side can initiate a new KEX, which replaces the existing keys
 - Disconnection
   - either side sends SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT

we need some cryptographic algorithms :
 - Keygen
   - provides a way to generate a public/private key pair, and use the private key to create signatures
 - Key EXchange (KEX)
   - establishes a shared secret
 - ciphers
   - uses the shared secret to encode messages
 - Message Authentication Code (MAC)
   - used to authenticate the message
SSH also supports the use of compression algorithms, but for now supporting 'none' is fine. 

for now, I'll just support one commonly supported algorithm for each type
 - KEX : curve25519 (X25519)
 - Hostkey / Userkey : ed25519
 - Cipher + MAC : chacha20-poly1305
