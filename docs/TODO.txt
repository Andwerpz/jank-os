above all, WRITE MORE TESTS!!!

  - commandline text editor, something like nano or vim

    - need to create TTY fd for io modification
    - also need to enable raw mode on linux side 
  - get mutex and other locks to work
  - get jjc to run on jankos
  - networking, able to make http requests to the outside world
  - graphic interface? (very low priority)

- done
