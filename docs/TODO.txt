above all, WRITE MORE TESTS!!!

overall goal : get jankos to run bare metal
this means we need a graphic interface, and replace the bootloader with something I understand
ok, next we have to consider from what we're going to boot from. Since writing to a hard drive is too hard, 
  I decided that I would try to make bootable USBs. However, this requires that I implement USB drivers.

- TODO
  - route serial io through interrupts
  - je optimizations
    - reduce alloc in print
  - shell improvements
    - keep track of previous commands, up/down arrow to browse previous commands
    - tab autocomplete current token in current dir
    - color??
    - shell pipes + redirects
  - more userspace utils
    - echo
    - grep
  - get mutex and other locks to work
    - specifically enable interrupts within system calls
  - get jjc to run on jankos
    - rewrite compiler + assembler in jank
  - networking, able to make http requests to the outside world
  - USB drivers
    - storage
    - keyboard

- done
  - finish rudimentary read/write filesystem
    - creating / removing / reading directories
    - creating / removing / reading / writing files
  - commandline text editor, something like nano or vim
    - seems like this is much more involved than I thought
    - need to create TTY fd for io modification
    - also need to enable raw mode on linux side 
  - replace bootboot with custom bootloader
  - graphic interface
    - implement vga terminal
    - ability to get input directly from the keyboard
    - seems like my laptop has PS/2 keyboard, we can go ahead and implement drivers for that
