above all, WRITE MORE TESTS!!!

 - finish rudimentary read/write filesystem
   - creating / removing / reading directories
   - creating / removing / reading / writing files
 - commandline text editor, something like nano or vim
 - get mutex and other locks to work
 - get jjc to run on jankos
 - networking, able to make http requests to the outside world
 - graphic interface? (very low priority)
