above all, WRITE MORE TESTS!!!

overall goal : get jankos to run bare metal
this means we need a graphic interface, and replace the bootloader with something I understand
ok, next we have to consider from what we're going to boot from. Since writing to a hard drive is too hard, 
  I decided that I would try to make bootable USBs. However, this requires that I implement USB drivers.
got some basic USB drivers working, can support storage devices that use SCSI BOT protocol. 
  now just have to actually get a physical drive and reformat it so we can test on bare metal

- TODO
  - ACPI power off
  - route serial io through interrupts
  - je optimizations
    - reduce alloc in print
  - shell improvements
    - keep track of previous commands, up/down arrow to browse previous commands
    - tab autocomplete current token in current dir
    - color??
    - shell pipes + redirects
  - more userspace utils
    - echo
    - grep
  - get mutex and other locks to work
    - specifically enable interrupts within system calls
  - get jjc to run on jankos
    - rewrite compiler + assembler in jank
  - networking, able to make http requests to the outside world
  - USB drivers
    - support PSIC custom speed mappings
    - error handling
    - USB hubs
      - pretty must just ability to handle complex USB device topology
      - USB core should maintain the USB device tree, xHCI controller just here to manage slots
    - HID keyboard
    - hotplug support
      - need to handle both unexpected connection and disconnection
      - connection is relatively simple, just have something always polling events and do device indexing logic when we see a port connection event
      - disconnection is tricky. USB core will keep track of the connection state and refcount for each device.
        when a port disconnect event happens, we immediately update the connection state to disconnected, clean up the device xHCI side,
        and any subsequent action on this device should return with ENODEV status without touching xHCI.
        when all the references to the USB device are gone, then it's safe to completely dealloc the device. 
      - hopefully a disconnect doesn't happen while we're indexing the device. However, I suppose we can introduce another
        device status like, INITIALIZING or something, and if a disconnect event happens while initializing, then
        we can just immediately dealloc the device. 

- done
  - finish rudimentary read/write filesystem
    - creating / removing / reading directories
    - creating / removing / reading / writing files
  - commandline text editor, something like nano or vim
    - seems like this is much more involved than I thought
    - need to create TTY fd for io modification
    - also need to enable raw mode on linux side 
  - replace bootboot with custom bootloader
  - graphic interface
    - implement vga terminal
    - ability to get input directly from the keyboard
    - seems like my laptop has PS/2 keyboard, we can go ahead and implement drivers for that
  - USB drivers
    - SCSI BOT mass storage devices
