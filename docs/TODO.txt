Andrew
 - make syscalls preemptible (kind of working)
 - make command to autogenerate filesystem from folder. 
   - should be able to call 'make drive' or smth and have it autogenerate the drive from the ./user folder
 - capability to run automated tests within the OS
   - for starters, can just look at return status code.
   - afterwards, would like to be able to redirect entire output to file and compare byte-by-byte with expected
   - could perhaps use all the jank-pl tests as a sanity check

Steven
 - create filesystem (L brain fog)

Sanat Dubey @ UCLA
