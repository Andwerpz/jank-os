uhh, follow these guidelines or something and your code will be more safe (?)
 
when writing in the kernel, try to prefix any functions, globals, structs, with the filename that it 
comes from if you find that it doesn't make sense to be prefixed, it should probably go in utils.jank

a function should never alloc and return a heap pointer, instead you should pass a preallocated pointer
into the function. This makes it so that allocs and deallocs of the same memory happen within the same 
context. 

if you want to allocate some heap memory, try to use malloc. It's acceptable to directly use the physical
allocator occasionally (function local temporary storage is the main example). Make extra sure that you 
always pfree() afterwards.

if you need to return a status code, always return i32 and 0 on success.
